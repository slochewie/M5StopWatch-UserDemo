# M5StopWatch MQTT Counter

MQTT synchronized capacity counter firmware for the M5Stack StopWatch.

## Overview

M5StopWatch MQTT Counter transforms the M5Stack StopWatch into a battery-powered MQTT counter device that can synchronize with other counters, web dashboards, and display devices through a central MQTT broker.

The project is based on the original M5Stack StopWatch User Demo firmware and has been modified to support MQTT-based counter synchronization using Node-RED as the authoritative source of truth.

## Features

- MQTT synchronized counter
- Multiple StopWatch devices stay in sync
- Increment counter
- Decrement counter
- Reset counter
- Real-time updates
- Touchscreen interface
- Battery powered operation
- Node-RED integration
- Web dashboard integration
- Compatible with additional MQTT display clients

```

Node-RED maintains the authoritative counter value.

All clients subscribe to the counter state topic and update their displays whenever a new value is published.

## Hardware

### Target Device

- M5Stack StopWatch
- ESP32-S3
- Round touchscreen display
- Integrated battery
- IMU motion sensor

## Button Mapping

| Button | Function |
| --- | --- |
| KEYB (Blue) | Increment |
| KEYA (Yellow) | Decrement |
| KEYA + KEYB | Reset |

## MQTT Topics

### Counter State

Topic:

```text
counters/capacity/state
```

Payload example:

```text
30
```

### Increment Command

Topic:

```text
counters/capacity/increment
```

Payload:

```text
1
```

### Decrement Command

Topic:

```text
counters/capacity/decrement
```

Payload:

```text
1
```

### Reset Command

Topic:

```text
counters/capacity/reset
```

Payload:

```text
1
```

## Software Components

### MQTT Broker

Tested with:

- Mosquitto MQTT

### Automation Platform

- Node-RED

Node-RED maintains the authoritative counter value and republishes state changes to all connected devices.

### Additional Clients

Examples:

- Web Dashboard (`counter.html`)
- M5StickS3 MQTT Counter
- GeekMagic SmallTV Pro MQTT Display
- Future mobile applications

## Development Environment

This project is developed using Espressif ESP-IDF.

### Requirements

- ESP-IDF v5.x
- Python 3.x
- Git
- USB-C connection to the StopWatch

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slochewie/M5StopWatch-MQTT-Counter.git
cd M5StopWatch-MQTT-Counter
```

## Configure Target

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
```

Optional:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

## Build

```bash
idf.py build
```

## Flash

```bash
idf.py flash
```

## Monitor

```bash
idf.py monitor
```

Flash and monitor:

```bash
idf.py flash monitor
```
